# HTTP DELETE Functionality in Flutter


A Flutter application demonstrating how to implement HTTP DELETE functionality to delete data from an API endpoint.


This Flutter application showcases the implementation of HTTP DELETE functionality using the Dart `http` package. The app interacts with a JSONPlaceholder API endpoint to delete an album record. It features a simple UI where users can input the ID of the album they wish to delete. Upon deletion, the app displays the title of the deleted album or a message indicating that the record has been deleted. The code demonstrates the usage of asynchronous functions, error handling, and state management to update the UI dynamically based on the API response.

## Repository Content:
The repository contains a Flutter project with the following key components:
- `main.dart`: The main application file containing the Flutter UI code and HTTP DELETE functionality.
- `README.md`: A markdown file providing instructions on how to run the application and detailing the functionality.
- Other necessary configuration files for the Flutter project.

This repository serves as a practical example for developers looking to implement HTTP DELETE requests in their Flutter applications.
